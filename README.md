# Spark MLlib for Churn Prediction Model

<details>

### Core Skills & Technologies:

* Developed and deployed a customer churn prediction model using PySpark, demonstrating proficiency in distributed data processing and machine learning at scale.
* Utilized Spark SQL and DataFrames for efficient data loading, manipulation, and transformation of a large customer dataset.
* Performed comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using PySpark and visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Plotly) to understand data distributions, correlations, and identify key features influencing churn.
* Implemented data preprocessing techniques in PySpark, including handling missing values (imputation), outlier detection and removal, and feature engineering.
* Applied feature preparation techniques such as Vector Assembling and numerical scaling (StandardScaler) in PySpark to prepare data for machine learning algorithms.
* Leveraged StringIndexer and VectorAssembler in PySpark to handle and vectorize categorical features for model training.
* Trained a Decision Tree classification model using PySpark MLlib to predict customer churn.
* Evaluated the performance of the churn prediction model using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), achieving a score of 0.77, demonstrating strong predictive capability for binary classification.
* Conducted hyperparameter tuning (e.g., `maxDepth` in Decision Tree) to optimize model performance and generalization using iterative evaluation and visualization.

### Problem Solving & Analytical Skills:

* Addressed a real-world business problem of customer churn prediction, showcasing the ability to apply data science methodologies to solve practical challenges.
* Identified and handled data quality issues such as missing values and outliers to ensure robust model training.
* Selected and applied appropriate feature engineering and selection techniques to improve model predictive power.
* Interpreted model evaluation results (AUC = 0.77) to assess the effectiveness of the churn prediction model.
* Provided actionable business recommendations based on the model's insights, such as suggesting strategies to reduce churn in specific customer segments.
* Investigated feature importance, identifying 'tenure', 'gender', and 'device protection' as key predictors of churn, and proposed further analysis.

### Project Specific Highlights:

* Achieved a strong predictive performance with an AUC of 0.77 on the test dataset, indicating a good ability to distinguish between churning and non-churning customers.
* Identified 'tenure' as the most significant predictor of churn, with shorter tenure correlating with higher churn rates.
* Analyzed the impact of 'gender' and 'device protection' on churn, noting their importance and recommending further investigation into the underlying reasons (e.g., through cross-tabulation with other features and qualitative research).
* Visualized churn patterns by contract type, tenure, and device protection, providing data-driven insights for targeted interventions.
* Successfully implemented a hyperparameter tuning process that contributed to the achieved AUC of 0.77.
